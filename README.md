fibonartcci
===========

It's Easter Sunday, Spring is coming and it's a shiny day (shiny!). Although the song in my headset tells me to look how it's nice outside and that it's time to play, I'd rather stay inside. But, instead of the usual infinite-loop week-endy slacking, let's do something. Reddit is talking about Fibonacci and it's been a long time since I haven't played with OpenGL/Pyglet.

Does it make sense ?
====================
Should it ?

Requirements
============
Pyglet (installed through pip like a gentleman, or copy-paste in the same folder like me), the Python OpenGL wrapper

Non-authoritative todo list
===========================
- Use something better than those weirdly positioned triangles to visually embody Fibonacci magnificence
- Shuffle the RGB equations once in a while
- Work on the sound part of the project (I wonder if right now, the really short sample time for a procedural sinus isn't screwing the generation and raising the pitch for technical reasons)
